# backend-assignment-MHA

Feature checklist:
- [x] Logging of requests to the backend
- [x] Retrieving request logs
- [x] Retrieving all users
- [x] Retrieving a user by ID
- [x] Deleting a user
- [x] Creating a new user
- [x] Created unit tests 

Few remarks:
- For simplicity, a user will be added as long as the id and the email are not the same. More checks can be added to make sure its a unique entry.

Running unit tests:
- `npm run test`
